00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.880
Recording by Ruth Golding.

6
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.160
A scandal in Bohemia.

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.880
To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman.

8
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.080
I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name.

9
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.080
In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex.

10
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.120
It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.

11
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.200
All emotions and that one particularly were apparent to his cold, precise, but admirably

12
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.040
balanced mind.

13
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.720
He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen.

14
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.280
But as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position.

15
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.880
He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a jive and a snare.

16
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.880
They were admirable things for the observer.

17
00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.600
And for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions.

18
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.800
But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finally

19
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:38.960
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor, which might throw a doubt upon all

20
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.760
his mental results.

21
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.200
Grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own high power lenses would not

22
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.400
be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.

23
00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.320
And yet there was but one woman to him.

24
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:06.280
And that woman was the late Irene Adler of dubious and questionable memory.

25
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.800
I had seen little of Holmes lately.

26
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.520
My marriage had drifted us away from each other.

27
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.120
My own complete happiness and the home-centered interests which rise up around the man who first

28
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.960
finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention.

29
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.360
While Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole behemian soul, remained in our

30
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.200
lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week

31
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.320
between cocaine and ambition.

32
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:49.960
The drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature.

33
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:56.600
He was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense

34
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.680
faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following up those clues and clearing up

35
00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.800
those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.

36
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.400
Some time to time I heard some vague account of his doings.

37
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.680
Of his summons to a deser in the case of the Trepoff murder.

38
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.280
Of his clearing up off the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trinkham-Ali.

39
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.680
And finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning

40
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.240
family of Holland.

41
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.800
Beyond these signs of activity however which I merely shared with all the readers of the

42
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.160
Daily Press I knew little of my former friend and companion.

43
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.240
One night it was on the 20th of March 1888.

44
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.600
I was returning from a journey to a patient, for I had now returned to civil practice,

45
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.240
when my way led me through Baker Street.

46
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.400
As I passed the well-remembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my

47
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.840
wooing, and with the dark incidence of the study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen

48
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:19.320
desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.

49
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.200
His rooms were brilliantly lit, and even as I looked up I saw his tall spare figure pass

50
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.920
twice in a dark silhouette against the blind.

51
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:36.920
He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest, and his

52
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.640
hands clasped behind him.

53
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:48.080
To me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story.

54
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.600
He was at work again.

55
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:58.440
He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem.

56
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:06.080
I rang the bell, and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.

57
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:13.960
His manner was not effusive, it seldom was, but he was glad, I think, to see me.

58
00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.880
With hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waived me to an armchair through across

59
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.640
his case of cigars and indicated a spirit-case and a gazegine in the corner.

60
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.640
When he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.

61
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:37.320
I'd lock suits you, he remarked.

62
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:43.720
I think Watson had to have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.

63
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.200
Seven, I answered.

64
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.080
Indeed I should have thought a little more.

65
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.840
That trifle more I fancy Watson.

66
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.880
And in practice again I observed.

67
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.560
You did not tell me that you intended to go into Honis?

68
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.080
Then how did you know?

69
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:09.320
I see it, I deduce it.

70
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:14.720
How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately?

71
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.880
And that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?

72
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.800
My dear Holmes said, I, this is too much.

73
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.440
You would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago?

74
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.920
It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have

75
00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.120
changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it.

76
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.880
I asked Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there again

77
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.360
I fail to see how you work it out.

78
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.520
She chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together.

79
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.840
"'It is simplicity itself,' said he.

80
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.080
"'My eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes

81
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.840
it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts.'

82
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:16.040
Obviously there have been cause by someone who has very carelessly scraped around the

83
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:20.880
edges of the soul in order to remove, crust it mud from it.

84
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:27.640
Hence, you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you

85
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:35.120
had a particularly malignant, boot-slitting specimen of the London Slavery.

86
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:41.640
As to your practice, if the gentleman walks into my room smelling a biode of form, with

87
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.760
a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right

88
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:54.200
side of his top hat, to show where he has secreted his death as scope, I must be dull,

89
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.120
indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.

90
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:05.960
I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction.

91
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:13.920
When I hear you give your reasons, I remarked, the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously

92
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.200
simple that I could easily do it myself.

93
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.120
Though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain

94
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.840
your process, and yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.

95
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:36.400
Quite so, he answered, lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair.

96
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:42.680
You see, but you do not observe, the distinction is clear.

97
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:49.320
For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.

98
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.320
Frequently?

99
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.320
How often?

100
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.200
Well, some hundreds of times.

101
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.280
Then how many are there?

102
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.280
How many?

103
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.400
I don't know.

104
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.880
Quite so.

105
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.080
You have not observed.

106
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.160
And yet you have seen?

107
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.960
That is just my point.

108
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:19.400
Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.

109
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.640
By the way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough

110
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:33.520
to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.

111
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:39.160
He threw over a sheet of thick, pink tinted note paper which had been lying open upon the

112
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.160
table.

113
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.920
It came by the last post, said he.

114
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.520
Read it aloud.

115
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:53.400
The note was undated and without either signature or address.

116
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:58.720
There will call upon you tonight at a quarter to eight o'clock, it said.

117
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:05.240
A gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment.

118
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.240
More recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who

119
00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:19.160
may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.

120
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.080
This account of you we have from all quarters received.

121
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.520
Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it a miss if you are visitor where

122
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.280
a mask.

123
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.440
This is indeed a mystery, I remarked.

124
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.600
What do you imagine that it means?

125
00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.240
I have no data yet.

126
00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:45.960
It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.

127
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:54.040
Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.

128
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:59.440
But the note itself, what do you deduce from it?

129
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.440
I carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written.

130
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:10.080
The man who wrote it was presumably well to do.

131
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.920
I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes.

132
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.880
Such paper could not be bought under half a crown of packet.

133
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.520
It is peculiarly strong and stiff.

134
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:28.280
Peculiar, that is the very word, said Holmes.

135
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:33.840
It is not an English paper at all, hold it up to the light.

136
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:43.600
I did so, and saw a large E with a small G, a P and a large G with a small T, woven into

137
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.160
the texture of the paper.

138
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.640
What do you make of that?

139
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.640
Asked Holmes.

140
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.600
The name of the maker, no doubt, or his monogram, rather.

141
00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:05.800
Not at all the G with a small T stands for gazelle shaft, which is the German for company.

142
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.720
It is a customary contraction like our coat.

143
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.080
P, of course, stands for papyr.

144
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.680
Now for the E G.

145
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:21.000
Let us glance at our continental gazette.

146
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.240
He took down a heavy brown volume from his shells.

147
00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.880
Egg, gloth, egg, glonet.

148
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.920
Here we are, egg, ria.

149
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:39.280
It is in a German-speaking country, in Bohemia, not far from Karlsberg.

150
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.560
Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Valenstein, and for its numerous glass factor

151
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.480
isn't paper mills.

152
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:50.440
Aha, my boy, what do you make of that?

153
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:56.520
His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.

154
00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:01.880
"'Nurk' paper was made in Bohemia,' I said, precisely.

155
00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:06.040
And the man who wrote the note is a German.

156
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:10.000
Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence?

157
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.320
This account of you we have from all quarters received.

158
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.680
A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that.

159
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:23.000
It is the German who is so uncurtious to his verbs.

160
00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.840
It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon

161
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:34.280
Bohemia and paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face.

162
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.040
And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.

163
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:47.240
As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb,

164
00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:52.160
followed by a sharp pull at the belt, Holmes whistled.

165
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.840
"'A pair by the sound,' said he.

166
00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.240
"'Yes,' he continued to glance-sing out of the window.

167
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:04.520
A nice little brum and a pair of beauties.

168
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:07.000
A hundred and fifty-geneers a piece.

169
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.080
There's money in this case Watson if there is nothing else.'

170
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.320
"'I think that I had better go, Holmes.'

171
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.320
"'Not a bit, Doctor.

172
00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.120
Stay where you are.

173
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.480
I am lost without my Boswell.

174
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.200
And this promise is to be interesting.

175
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.720
It would be a pity to miss it.'

176
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:29.520
"'Burt your client?'

177
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.280
Never mind him.

178
00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.840
I may want your help and so may he.'

179
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.640
"'Here he comes.

180
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:42.600
Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.'

181
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:48.760
A slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately

182
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.520
outside the door.

183
00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.440
Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.

184
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:58.360
"'Come in,' said Holmes.

185
00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:04.080
A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with

186
00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.000
the chest and limbs of a hercules.

187
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.280
His dress was rich with a richness which would in England be looked upon as a kind of

188
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.600
bad taste.

189
00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.440
Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted

190
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:26.400
coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with

191
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:32.100
flame-coloured silk, and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single

192
00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.880
flaming barrel.

193
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.960
Boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich

194
00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:49.600
brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance.

195
00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.840
He carried a broad brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his

196
00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:01.480
face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black visored mask which he had apparently

197
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:08.120
adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered.

198
00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:13.480
From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick

199
00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:21.160
hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.

200
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.920
You're hard to my note!

201
00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:30.400
He asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent.

202
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.560
I told you that I've had core.

203
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.360
He looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address.

204
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:43.240
«Braid take a seat,' said Holmes.

205
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:49.600
This is my friend and colleague Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me

206
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:51.680
in my cases.

207
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.640
Whom have I the honour to address?

208
00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:01.280
You may address me as the Count von Kahn, a Bohemian noble man.

209
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:09.040
I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may

210
00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:13.960
test with a matter of the most extreme importance.

211
00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:19.240
If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.

212
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:26.000
I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair.

213
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.440
"'It is both so none,' said he.

214
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:36.520
You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.'

215
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.880
The Count shrugged his broad shoulders.

216
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:48.040
"'Then I must begin,' said he, by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years.

217
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:52.280
At the end of that time the matter will be of no importance.

218
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:58.440
At present it is not too much to say that it is of such a weight it may have an influence

219
00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.440
upon European history.

220
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:11.520
"'I promise,' said Holmes, "'and I,' you will excuse this mask,' continued our strange

221
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.520
visitor.

222
00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:19.000
The Auguste-Parson who employs me, this is his agent to be unknown to you.

223
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.880
And I may confess advance that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly

224
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.880
my own.'

225
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.800
"'I was aware of it,' said Holmes, dryly.

226
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:38.960
The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to crunch

227
00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:45.640
what might go to be an immense scungle and seriously compromise one of the reigning families

228
00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:47.360
of Europe.

229
00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:56.160
To speak plenty the matter implicates the great house of Ormstein, heradetry kings of Bohemia.

230
00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:04.360
"'I was also aware of that,' murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and

231
00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.360
closing his eyes.

232
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:12.920
Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man

233
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:19.200
who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic

234
00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.360
agent in Europe.

235
00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:27.960
Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.

236
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:35.120
"'If your majesty would condescend to state your case,' he remarked, "'I should be

237
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:38.440
better able to advise you.'

238
00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:45.080
The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation.

239
00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:50.600
Then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the

240
00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.600
ground.

241
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.280
"'You are I'd,' he cried, "'I am the king.

242
00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.800
Why should I attempt to conceal it?'

243
00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:02.320
"'I indeed,' murmured Holmes.

244
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:08.840
Your majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottzreich

245
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:17.400
Sigis Mond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Castle Felstein and hereditary king of Bohemia.

246
00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:23.360
"'But you can understand,' said a strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing

247
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.160
his hand over his high white forehead.

248
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:33.240
"'You can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person.

249
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:40.080
Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting

250
00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.360
myself in his power.

251
00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:49.880
I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.'

252
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:56.520
"'Then pray consult,' said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.

253
00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.640
The facts are briefly these.

254
00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:07.240
Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made a acquaintance of the well-known

255
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:11.680
adventurice, Irene Adler.

256
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:16.440
Her name is no doubt familiar to you.'

257
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.800
Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor.

258
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.920
Murmord Holmes, without opening his eyes.

259
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:30.600
For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things,

260
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.280
so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once

261
00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.240
furnish information.

262
00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:44.080
In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that

263
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:48.600
of a staff commander who had written a monograph upon the deep sea fishes.

264
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.480
"'Let me see,' said Holmes.

265
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:59.320
"'Mmm, born in New Jersey in the year 1858.

266
00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.320
Contralto.

267
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.320
La Scala.

268
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:10.760
Prima Donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw, yes.

269
00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.560
Retired from operatic stage?

270
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.800
Ah, living in London, quite so.

271
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:23.680
Your majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person.

272
00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:30.600
Wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.

273
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:33.320
Preciously so.

274
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.360
But how?

275
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.760
Was there a secret marriage?

276
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.760
None.

277
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:42.280
No legal papers or certificates.

278
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.280
None.

279
00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.200
Then I failed to follow your majesty.

280
00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:54.480
If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how

281
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.120
is she to prove their authenticity?

282
00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.080
There is writing.

283
00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.000
Puff, forgery.

284
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.760
My private note paper.

285
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.760
Stolen.

286
00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.600
My own seal.

287
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.680
Immitated.

288
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.760
My photograph.

289
00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.760
Bought.

290
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.840
The above both in the photograph.

291
00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:19.960
Oh dear.

292
00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.240
That is very bad.

293
00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:28.240
Your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.

294
00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:32.560
I was mad in saying.

295
00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.040
You have compromised yourself seriously.

296
00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.320
I was only calm, Princeton.

297
00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.720
I was young.

298
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.440
I am at thirty now.

299
00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.520
It must be recovered.

300
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:48.240
If you have tied and failed.

301
00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.000
Your majesty must pay.

302
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
It must be bought.

303
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.560
She will not sell.

304
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.080
Stolen then.

305
00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.560
Five attempts have been made.

306
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.800
Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house.

307
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:06.160
Once they diverted her luggage when she travelled.

308
00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.880
Twice she has been veiled.

309
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.320
There has been no result.

310
00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.400
No sign of it.

311
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.560
Absolutely none.

312
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.560
Holmes laughed.

313
00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:21.640
It is quite a pretty little problem, said he.

314
00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:28.280
What a very serious one to me, returned the king reproachfully.

315
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:34.400
Very indeed, and what does she propose to do with the photograph?

316
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.600
To ruin me.

317
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.600
But how?

318
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:41.440
I am about to be married.

319
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.720
So I have heard.

320
00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:50.720
To clothe tilde Lortmann, Fond Sucks, Minning and second daughter of the King of Scandinavia.

321
00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.520
You may know the strict principles of her family.

322
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.400
She is herself the very soul of delicacy.

323
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:04.760
A shadow of a doubt has to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.

324
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.240
And Rainy Adler?

325
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:11.240
Threatens to send them the photograph, and she will do it.

326
00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.720
I know that she will do it.

327
00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:18.320
You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel.

328
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:26.160
She has the face of the most beautiful women, and the mind of the most isolated Lortmann.

329
00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.840
Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go

330
00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:31.840
none.

331
00:25:31.840 --> 00:25:35.600
You are sure that she has not sent it yet?

332
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.920
I am sure.

333
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.720
And why?

334
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:44.320
Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly

335
00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.080
proclaimed.

336
00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:48.480
That will be next Monday.

337
00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.960
Oh, then we have three days yet.

338
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.840
Said Holmes with a yawn.

339
00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.760
That is very fortunate as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just

340
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.640
at present.

341
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:05.560
Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present.

342
00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:06.560
Certainly.

343
00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:12.040
You will find me at the langum under the name of the Count Fond Corm.

344
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.840
Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.

345
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:18.400
Pray do so.

346
00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.440
I shall be all anxiety.

347
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:27.360
Then as to money, you have carte blanche.

348
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.360
Absolutely.

349
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:36.040
I tell you that I could give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.

350
00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:39.160
And for present expenses.

351
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:44.360
The king took a heavy chamileather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.

352
00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:51.120
There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes, he said.

353
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:56.680
Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his notebook and handed it to him.

354
00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:04.640
And Mamm Zell's address, he asked, is Brianny Lodge serpentine Avignon St. John's

355
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.640
Wood?

356
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.080
Holmes took a note of it.

357
00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:11.040
One other question, said he.

358
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.760
Was the photograph a cabinet?

359
00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:15.880
It was.

360
00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.760
Then good night, Your Majesty.

361
00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:23.640
And I trusted we shall soon have some good news for you.

362
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.680
And good night Watson.

363
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:30.720
He added as the wheels of the Royal Brom rolled down the street.

364
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.880
If you will be good enough to call tomorrow afternoon at three o'clock, I should like

365
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:41.200
to chat this little matter over with you.

366
00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.400
End of part one of Adventure One, a scandal in Bohemia.
